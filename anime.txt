well says it! ask because supposedly hyuuga uchiha descendants rikudou's eldest son least under impression way byakugan other special techniques awakened such tsukuyomi susano'o amaterasu sharingan ultimately awaken rinnegan far seen techniques derive byakugan itself rather techniques possible because it: whole hyuuga fighting style comes use byakugan same way every mangekyou technique sharingan able develop/and use properly due having byakugan again same way mangekyou sharingan sum up: possible byakugan user awaken rinnegan 
unlikely true kakashi originally said uchiha clan sharingan branch off hyuuga clan byakugan later revealed wasn't case even though kaguya otsutsuki said byakugan currently presumed two bloodlines separate there's actual connection two eye techniques byakugan upgrades ever discussed/revealed like said hyuuga specific techniques byakugan's potential being utilized revealed way awaken rinnegan combine indra's ashura's chakra like madara who indra's chakra implanted flesh hashirama who ashura's chakra bring out sage six paths' chakra so theoretically indra posses hyuuga clan member identity ashura known possible however never happened likely happen future /blo

says all i'll elaborate: see techniques derived single chakra element katon doton suiton fuuton raiton these most common since usually ninja master one chakra nature since normally ninjas tend affiliation one chakra nature discover these combined number ways elements mokuton=doton+suiton ranton=raiton+suiton youton=katon+doton among several others understand these usually transmitted kekkei genkai believe created combinations elements ninja who inherit other generations correct wrong these uncommon less frequent ones above ninja who master possess affiliation more one chakra nature: sasuke comes mind since master katon raiton katon clan's natural affiliation mastered raiton too however has ever combined later find combinations more elements ninja who master several elements such muu nidaime tsuchikage oonoki sandaime tsuchikage who combine katon doton fuuton create jinton these called kekkei touta know transmitted through kekkei genkai taught even rarer ones above since ninja rarely master naturally affiliated more two chakra natures terumii mei godaime mizukage master doton katon suiton think ever combines more two each time questions are: combinations chakra natures taught transmitted kekkei genkai combinations more three chakra natures possible above question created one me: ninja master more three chakra natures think kakashi quite sure 
naruto group abilities called kekkei genkai ???? told abilities usually passed down genetically within specific clans eye techniques dojutsu ?? such sharingan subset abilities first appear appear naturally made purpose result experiments 
guessing would've appeared naturally other doujutsu byakugan rinnegan legend has these clans descended rikudou's eldest son who received father's powerful chakra spiritual energy genkai ninjutsu: think these developed ninja who possessed special abilities chakra nature affiliations later passed down next generations according ninja 's page creations indeed bloodlines genetic advantages: potential bloodlines genetic advantages seem passable down onto next generation such suigetsu's mangetsu's body unique gives genetic advantage think these could've basis development kekkei genkai early stages clans though suigetsu's mangetsu's case think considered kekkei genkai could've linked early stages development clan's special technique found out these leaf ninja's page 
think combinations kekkei genkai all combinations shown kekkai genkais think combinations more three possible because one nature block other compare suiton katon because five natures" can't combination more four natures without blocking one ninjutsu all five nothing guess written comments thanks jnat possible combine elements time order correctly naruto hiden: sha sho stated shinobi learn more two theoretically five natures however using all once one attack complicated 
quote combinations chakra natures taught transmitted kekkei genkai think combinations chakra generally possible through kekkei genkai even transplantation eg kakashi sharingan there's issue lord tsuchikage manga claims master passed him ability combine revealed whether share blood so treat grain salt combinations more three chakra natures possible tota combination three elements such dust release already so guess now aren't revealed possible above question created one me: ninja master more three chakra natures think kakashi quite sure kakashi masters four natures one according anime are: anime 
since very hard answer mix more chakra types doubt stated anywhere manga i'll try answer two other parts question start easiest one: ninja master more three chakra natures depends mean generic answer believe kakashi shown use elements earth fire anime water lightning use wind techniques able help naruto training so least knows something note that: has natural affinity lightning has used water techniques level matched level zabuza who water specialist say least two elements definitely use another two uses fire anime though now taking into account think safe assume possible use all elements seen opinions internet unconfirmed though every shinobi actually learn techniques every element chose use element natural affinity debatable interesting opinion question combinations chakra natures taught transmitted kekkei genkai believe least three techniques: jinton yoton jiton more one user apparent blood each other onoki has stated secrets jinton passed him mu so implies least suggests these abilities transmitted kekkei genkai so say ways however given information now impossible absolutely sure 
seems first kekkei genkai rinnegan rikudo sennin because first ninja think kekkei genkai experiment literally it" kekkai genkais like sharingan mutations kekkei genkais compare jnat's answer combinations like hakus hyoton mutations suddenly appearing somewhere world 
chakra element combination supposedly born trait shinbo one chakra element master few more secondary elements clans such senju born elements earth water naturally combine form wood element thought two element combinations possible discovered three indeed possible see reason isn't possibility four more based latest manga chapters seems least element combination possible although initial estimate third wrong examples ninja mastering all five chakra elements kakuzo great example all five water earth fire lightning wind one body though cheat used different hearts so possible said who awaken rinnegan master all elements including yinyang element together since hasn't happened yet can't sure six paths sage chakra creates gudodama called confirmed combination all elements: fire water earth lightning wind yinyang /blo

most obvious answer everyone internet giving question anime produced much faster compared manga need put fillers order slow down anime series" however shouldn't reason example consider one piece show going more episodes less fillers comparing naruto show has almost same number episodes original shippuuden combined almost episodes fillers needless say manga naruto so far ahead anime able catch even produce episodes without fillers

mainly because battle centered animes like naruto bleach lot battle scenes battle scenes much faster anime manga centered animes like one piece death note afford produce many fillers because leave gap far enough apart plot events unfold much faster anime naruto specific answer upcoming saga filled battles order compensate fast-pace anime sufficient gap needs opened exact numbers calculations like think anime producers sort plan keep upcoming battle saga intact guess who'll delivering meteors houses 
lots possible explanations that: said anime catching manga so more time events anniversaries movie-related specials so narratives different depends production team your example naruto bleach commonly makes battles really fast-paced so tend catch-up manga quickly whereas one piece having lots battle too tends make less dynamic so end longer catch manga easily

battling tobi seen ninjas getting teleported place kind dark room having floor made blocks real place like cave somewhere far tobi's subconscious mind required considering fighting scene tobi kakashi-naruto kakashi teleported into place kakashi counter attacks kumui making tobi bleedcough blood kakashi manages return back battle field

tailed beast's power seems greater more tails has example: -tailed beast power -tails -tails -tailed beast power -tails -tails -tails clear possible compare power level -tails -tails equation power -tailed beast power -tailed one greater links: shared same idea link answer thread 
although explicitly stated such supposedly gathered several sharingans during uchiha incident room operated sasuke probably preserves has showed standing next one two other occasions 
actually chapter page hachibi tells kyuubi isn't determined number tails one has width="" height=" part page kyuubi think number tails equals power reason friction te bijuu stated naruto wiki page bijuu time said number tails really determine power one bijuu has has other explanation power bijuus 
actually never explicitly said bijuu stronger bijuu lesser tail number practical power probably determined tail number even though eight tails told nine tails isn't much like 'friendship' more valued 'power' stated nine tails stronger all rest combined because itachi said sealed anytime last gedo mazo able withstand imbalance break apart isn't clear power distribution balance nothing explicitly stated so most you'll hear speculation specific question say two tails stronger" one tail 
zetsu know tobi beginning tobi has interacted white zetsu moment arrived madara's cave black zetsu created madara obito's presence reason zetsu supposedly knowing tobi wanted keep hidden other akatsuki members haven't thought time 
explained more detail manga anime viewers wouldn't know exactly tobi's power location dimension unique him actually since tobi has same eye kakashi dimension shared tobi freely insert extract objects to/from dimension kakashi apparently insert things distance extract directly eye kakshi's counter attack happened because tobi used kamui teleport part him going get hit 'real' world dimension kakshi waiting dimension hit him stomach causing him spew blood kakshi later returned real world own kamui /blo 
rather dismissing license" rather see time passing differently different dimensions kyuubi" takes place special dimension inside junchuuriki instance technique prowess technique has allowed him perception time ease within genjutsu make few seconds seem like many days means torture target /blo 
naruto's sage technique free form energy manipulates wind-natured chakra rasengan create rasenshuriken however used case managed create maximum rasenshurikens adding wind chakra before sage mode came end granted unlimited chakra kyuubi create unlimited number rasenshuriken 
think so believe kyuubi's chakra isn't unlimited first kyuubi cares naruto wastes chakra second hachibi's fight against sandaime raikage suggests chakra beast isn't unlimited because hachibi knocked out because exhaustion because beasts pure chakra think mean has too less chakra /blo 
primary principle controlling jinchuuriki think two possibilities: hatred/negative thoughts wish tailed beast bee easily get good hachibi recall falls truth incident bee easily pass second because hatred anyone around him heart so because suppressed negative thoughts hence got tailed beast under control because hachibi himself really good guy who broadminded enough lend chakra bee 
stated gaara has dark circles around eyes because shukaku let him sleep because gaara lose control extraction shukaku gaara still has these circles around eyes still suffer insomnia 
really make sense know one gaara's trademark techniques armor sand: image description whole body covered layer sand protects him course means can't really see skin under sand so personally think doubtful marks because lack sleep first place whatever gaara who has marks around eyes notable examples being kankuro: image description baki: image description opinion rather element style 
song rina sings opening/ending -- existing pop song japan song created series 
bijuu control achieved ways madara uchiha's way force earning respect tailed beast question past madara battled hashirama valley end summoned controlled nine tails power genjutsu using sharingan naruto killerbee however earned respective tailed beast trust tailed beasts ancient beings very bitter constantly being sealed used humans developed deep resentment humans naruto killerbee succumbing powerful negative emotions showing desire work against tailed beast earned respect achieved whole level power second method far stronger first 
kyuubi's chakra definitely unlimited there's limit much naruto use kyuubi tells naruto more one occassion he's being reckless chakra kyuubi looks older naruto first takes chakra finally naruto uses too much kyuubi's chakra kyuubi's chakra take naruto way get unlimited rasen-shuirken present time 
very possible gaara's circles around eyes remnents shukaku lived insomniac vast majority life very recent he's living without shukaku gaara still isn't most friendly guy he's learning build bonds because man free mean knows free takes time learn affects wear off

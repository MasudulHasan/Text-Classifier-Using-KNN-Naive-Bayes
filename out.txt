thinking recycling filament couple recently failed prints reuse future basic prototypes so concerned whatever weird mixture colors come out few different colors thing pla abs small quantities originally intended simply use each one separately occurred mixed recycle pla abs together into one strand filament negative side effects eg reduced strength 
good idea filaments different melting points abs being much higher pla melt abs heat plastic point pla starts degrade 
usual solution cleaning glass bed printer glass scraper basically razor blade handle it: scraper kind filament abs/pla/nylon surface treatment glue/painters tape/abs slurry used glass scraper always takes right off style posted picture blade flexible thin enough useful peeling edge prints stuck bed 
operating laser sintering machine using polyamide powder grain size approximately micrometers during print lot powder goes unsintered theoretically reused however using purely recycled powder degrades print quality unacceptable level little used powder into larger amount fresh powder seems work well though greatest ratio used fresh powder still gives good results anything pre- postprocessing allow more powder reused 
usually either rip tape break print somehow currently using abs taped glass bed layer hairspray adhesion 
let's say print part out abs wait cool theoretically several copies same printer modified use print beds different compositions material bed made out affect long takes part cool 
you'll find generally mixing polyamide recycled polyamide result reasonable finish part obviously want use all parts requiring best possible finish mechanical properties mixture very difficult tell apart fully mixture part: more detailed research showing used powder changes affects print quality here: research paper find free source linked resource require subscription payment service 
moved plain glass heated bed brush applied acetone abs mixture using old emptied nail polish bottle brush added acetone threw abs pieces until reached brush-able consistency brush glass build plate believe print occur works very well removal part coating comes found previously abs adhere kapton taped heated bed too strongly use so involves little work before each print overall better kapton experiment sheet metal beds coated kapton curl during printing due abs thermal stress allowing parts concave bottom side easy remove plate though since flexed good middle ground material experiment further 
assuming meaning build plate confusing printed raft yes different materials build plate different cooling rates know values hand google search get formula calculate long certain size build plate given material type roughly take cool using mobile app right now so i'll get back answer later give links more details 
bed material cools faster found list various materials conductivity [w/mk] lower thermal conductivity better material insulates slower print bed resist changes temperature heating cooling down thermal conductivity common materials printer beds: glass ?rylic ªir reference matter thermal capacity go into right now need research myself first! bed material affect cooling time material believe necessarily print cooldown time: depends situation such whether discussing cooldown during after printing bed heated using heated bed believe bed material matter all heated bed printing first dozen layers so probably affected rising heat sufficiently affects printing process heated bed printing thermal characteristics bed determine quickly print cools thus removed remember other physical properties such flatness cold during heating bed material vital successful prints all materials tolerate heating equally well! 
two standard filament sizes mm mm really make difference printing mm smaller printers situations using mm using mm 
there's appreciable difference use filament fits your particular printer yet printer get one uses mm filament: increasingly becoming thus being easier get filaments available mm filament allows finer control because feeding mm filament corresponds less plastic extruded filament requires less force extrude compressing mm down mm takes less force doing same mm filament advantages fairly minor see reason replace functioning mm extruder mm one yet 
few factors consider two: rigid easier print flexible plastics couldn't make mm printer print ninjaflex using standard bowden extruder extrude faster less affected changes diameter concern mostly using cheap plastics popular easier buy smaller extruder mm use bowden tube precise printing 
believe post @tbm covers many general options however consider additional fans improve cooling model during printing pointed out excellent article installing fan significantly reduce issues printing overhangs regarding type fan get stated that: seems fan shroud choose less important fan type blower fan consistently weighted above stock mm fan regardless shroud using blower gives best possible airflow through shroud decide use addition experience adding having two more fans blowing model different directions further improve overhang performance because all parts print less likely experience lack cooling due shadow 
think lot others differences rather minor so things know experience we've using mm years now moving towards mm filament very easy entangle especially spool even easily create knots filament very hard untangle long keep spool always buy spool fine mm filament other hand creates very high tension spool end sometimes last couple meters unusable because throw rest spool away 
extension question reason able use mm filament printer takes mm filament know change filament size slicing prints other problems using mm filament possible nozzle diameter greater mm less mm 
work short time you're going fill melt chamber quickly possibly overflow point filament isn't constrained causing messy jam all molten plastic likely flow backwards point diameter isn't mm longer probably next your drive gear depending length flow cool down jam extruder filament pass through unheated anything 
printing week now printer getting great results including great adhesion however most prints fairly small footprint stepping types items printing started run into problem long thin parts starting lift off bed especially edges bed read question dealing issue abs realize most apply however printing entirely pla non-heated bed question is: best way go troubleshooting problem order attempt fixes narrow down problem most quickly monoprice maker architect very similar makerbot pla bed: material: something similar buildtak top acrylic bed sheet material came unlabeled printer haven't able track down exactly 
several things try without spending much even pla warp unheated bed legacy kossel switched acrylic bed many issues warping prints pulling off bed cheap things try brim print painters tape acrylic remove other material doing cheap piece glass/mirror bed use hairspray/gluestick hairspray/gluestick directly acrylic must careful because first layer height very critical prevent damage acrylic plastic welding layer hairspray glue prevent dial your height before printing aren't currently using fan try sealing sides prevent drafts doubt change much since using pla option these your designs steps take reduce warping seen many other suggestions 
typically extruder hot end designed one other cannot support other without mechanical changes extruder able grip smaller diameter filament enough force assure even feeding retraction hot end however much more complex filament has pushed force into melting zone means filament has slide along area inside hot end filament plastic still put pressure filament ahead put filament into hot end filament softens before melt zone since walls hot end barely larger filament has choice continue pressing down liquid filament below narrower diameter filament though filament heat soften travel along sides hot end cool place jamming hot end least preventing even continuous flow plastic hot ends accept small teflon tube takes space allows fewer issues like tinker experiment prepared learn lot fail lot find out hard lessons hot end design upgrade your entire extruder hot end setup size want use 
sounds like em interference though adam's points connections good bet try re-routing thermistor wires far away other wires helps either leave re-routed shield case please let know find 
all ways think of: temperature down little reduce sagging cooling like bigger fans aimed print so solidifies faster orientation possible case soluble support material wash away afterwards requires -head printer print go insert support material manually ick support material very top out support material afterwards more precise tool like drill sander same diameter bearing eagerly waiting boxzy printer swap milling head place extruder support material now remove too much fill gap after installing bearing prevent wobbling -- epoxy hot-melt glue melted pla etc work depending part end being used set-screw secure bearing course these all tradeoffs hope least one help 
modify shown picture added lines tangent mm circle example set degree overhang fine top line tangent circle experience easier bridge small section rather bunch small overhangs like arc still end quite bit contact easy print something similar printer smooth rods enter horizontal holes overhang

quality depends things: pellets stored before during extrusion humidity filter your extruder get rid random junk air bubbles ending your filament micron wire mesh filter secret formula filament producing companies very efficient very fast filament producing machines course very expensive too comes vanilla abs pla almost same content personal experience: get same pellets store same place run your extruder same place behave same think filament mixture able find anywhere able make yourself cheaper example: mixing strontium aluminate powder glow dark filament come many colors green recommend design: produces filament pretty fast one full kg spoon hours make sure enough experience electrocute yourself assembling heaters use mains power personally think commercial extruders worth money own filastruder different slower above unless care pretty plywood case your extruder see advantage since uses off-the-shelf parts itself bother buying kit like sourcing parts yourself

that's temperature problem you've encountered temperature bed hotend reported every few seconds per default first sets bed temperature need wait bed reach warm hotend start printing 
probably result bad quality filament haven't changed much your setups haven't changed slicers changed spools result try using another spool perhaps switch suppliers know expensive seems stigma around makerbot industries provides quality pla abs you've suggest case following: height other suggestions be: level your build plate material requirements ie abs ideal -c according msds build plate temp pla -c sometimes too hot hotend result overextrusion ooze cylinder smaller try changing your slicing settings time minimum each layer experience material like abs begin flare out variations print environment material flares out nozzle comes across area again flared areas pushed aside adjust your slicing settings seconds calculator material time cool slightly plastic state cheat slightly adding another object somewhere further plate same height since time takes rapid area print layer enough time cooling recommend doing depth maintenance eliminate obvious problems such cleaning your nozzle rods belts etc

added fan printer because very small layers seem come out very badly example mm pla cube that's top level test shape shown below watching closely see newly-extruded fiber pushing previous layers around pretty freely object finished little top cube bulging rounded still soft touch nd-to-top level object quite small quick comes out nicely anything better before added fan fan squirrel-cage cm square outlet pointing nozzle cm away running full speed extruder mk tried telling pronterface wait level too brief setting seems anything else try seems like not-enough-cooling problem perhaps something else too sample step-cube 
layer times answer question pay particular attention suggestion minimum layer print time sure all slicing engines provide option know makerware/makerbot desktop possibly slicr allow setting you're extruding smaller features like previous layers still very hot possibly very pliable so your nozzle moves around above previous layer nozzle probably push molten plastic around chances see certain degree printing definitely see most drastic state print tall small diameter cylinder you'll notice part become almost exponentially unstable higher goes increasing time your printer takes print single layer allowing previous layers cool closer ambient temperature build space hopefully molten refer calculator similar one material cooling times standard shell setting mm nozzle yield sec cool down room temperature recommend abs/pla least second minimum each layer possibly longer depending size spread out features note cheated simply printing multiple items same build plate same heights ie multiples same part naturally take longer machine print rest parts therefore allow each layer cool slightly before being printed cooling slicing engines active cooling setting personally option setup machine believe regulates flow air directed your nozzle usually use mounted fan help cool layers bit faster abs result pretty bad warping mid-print bringing down your feedrates provide printed portions current layer more time cool above options aren't available note bring down your hotend temp shorten time takes cool plastic else fails other suggestion stated above try printing duplicates same plate diagnosis previous layers aren't cooling down enough before next layer begins

printer controllers lot stuff very very fast performing kinematics dynamics calculations sending many thousands precisely-synchronized step pulses per second really hard bit avr line microcontrollers used older printer controllers basically late-s era mr coffee processor completely utterly maxed out processor time executing basic printing functions simple eg cartesian printers adding additional calculation load bog down cause slowdowns stuttering pausing so bit printer works fine" say your print performance limited whether realize slicers now automatically hide lot firmware's performance shortcomings example standard practice greatly slowing down print speeds perimeters largely result bit processors having inadequate resources two things: centripetal acceleration calculations curves?ross multiple gcode segments gcode transmission/processing motion planning gcode lots very small segments such organic models smooth arcs presented series very small segments smooth arc complex curve bit firmware likely choke required command processing rate introduce stuttering print these incredibly brief pauses allow residual pressure extruder push out extra plastic making little zit print so most slicers automatically decimate curves output gcode reduced resolution lighten load firmware problem solved right there's another issue -- grbl motion control algorithms underlying all major open source printer controllers designed lots shortcuts hacks allow bit processors execute fast enough example basic algorithm looks speed velocity change corner two segments uses decide decelerate/accelerate along direction motion calculate consider centripetal/radial acceleration whatsoever really effective hack printing boxy low-res models fails miserably smooth curves lots little segments firmware detect appreciable velocity change corner two nearly-linear segments within faceted curve thus slow down curve so complex geometry effectively printed constant velocity acceleration complex perimeters unaccelerated means commanded feedrate must very low get good quality most printers limited mm/s less complex perimeters despite being able run perhaps -mm/s low-complexity infill before hitting other speed limits command processing rate limits motion planner shortcomings required low power processors print speeds must much lower practice strictly required physics printer

interrupt other processing tasks printer must perform -- like acceleration calculations heater control -- get squeezed into brief spaces stepper interrupt events careful firmware design step pulses completely out" other functionality like lcd display updates acceleration calculations order allow higher motion rates without using all processor resources bit firmwares mode called doubling" fires two four eight step pulses per stepper interrupt so half quarter eighth many stepper interrupts used produce same motion speed practice de-bottlenecks processor causes rougher louder motor motion because step pulses fired bursts rather constant frequency effect microstepping level motor functionally dropped coarser mode stepper interrupt fires double quad steps so motors get louder less precise extreme cases problems resonance interesting side effect switch marlin-based printer microstepping microstepping keep same print speeds firmware simply start step-doubling dropping your effective microstepping level right back down / firmwares use step doubling allowable step rates typically times higher before double/quad stepping used mean higher speeds and/or smoother motion issue bit avrs lack hardware floating point need spend many clock cycles high-precision calculations handling very large numbers delta kinematics auto-leveling functions calculating moves extremely high

four main motor speed limits printer are: step generation frequency limits motion planner effects torque precision due motor coil inductance back-emf effects resonance generation rate limits depend firmware controller board used significant range particularly bit firmwares rtos-based platforms like machinekit compared bit firmwares running atmega avrs examples: mhz bit atmega run stepper interrupt hz without bogging down processor blocking other critical algorithms like motion planning fire step rates hz pulsing step line two four times per interrupt effectively drops microstep level software runs motors rougher/louder same atmega run stepper interrupt hz because optimized more execution speed marlin mhz bit arm cortex-m run stepper interrupt hz limits typically affect actual stepper speed fine microstepping used consider example based very typical marlin printer configuration microstepping least strongly recommended avoid resonance issues so let's start stepping allows quad-stepping effectively output /-steps starting finer microstepping drop top speed coarser microstepping louder encounter resonance so good starting point asssume typical mm-per-rev pulley degree steps/rev stepper motor system has resolution */= steps/mm hz total stepping rate quad-stepping hz theoretically travel mm/s before hitting marlin's hard cap that's probably going higher rpm want run motor anyway so very impactful limit comparison started stepping such thb driver chip top speed bit marlin mm/s that's quite slow motion planners further limits motor speed ramping down traverse turns corners model geometry has lots sharp turns target speeds commanded gcode likely never actually reached long straight line paths enough ramping time hit speed target see yourself printing very small model variety feedrates timing actual print duration: certain point increases commanded speed make difference actual print times constraint firmwares enforce requiring ability safely decelerate stop within length all motion commands planner queue allows printer gracefully handle sudden loss input such host computer stops transmitting usb commands sd card experiences series read errors printer abruptly stops full speed runs out commands likely lose position ruin print whereas decelerate safe stopping speed able resume after command stream resumes terms actual motor behavior back-emf introduce significant limits because decrease motor torque higher rpms produces torque/rpm curve drops off higher speeds: image description picture flat current" region left side low speeds range chopping driver limiting coil current right side curve current able reach target before must switched back off next step reduces field strength thus torque two separate effects consider here: coils inductors means first-order lag applied voltage coil current standard bipolar stepper motor microstepping driver must raise coil current zero max max zero every full step eg every sixteen /th microsteps high step rates enough time fully charge coil max current before next step requires dropping current back down without developing full coil current each step torque lost motor generator spinning rotor generates back-emf voltage within motor coils voltage waveform gets overlaid top drive voltage waveform phase shift dependent rotor position coil energization position simple terms voltage attempts brake motor: always whatever slow motor down means opposes applied drive voltage motor applying forward torque assists applied drive voltage motor applying brake torque practical discussion speed limits simplify situation assuming back-emf voltage opposes drive voltage applied coils means less effective voltage raising/lowering coil current takes longer current change less coil current developed case without back-emf further depresses torque/rpm curve motor back-emf voltage around same magnitude drive voltage significant motor instability result because complex feedback effects rotor position effective coil voltage play these effects using different motor configurations speeds few popular printer stepper drivers using stepper driver simulator: closed-loop applications position feedback high-end drivers damp various instability modes ok run stepper all way down torque curve very high rpms more typical open-loop printer applications generally best stick low-rpm part torque curve before inductance back-emf really take motor behavior losing too much torque easily mean skipping steps losing position ruining print important effect steppers resonance normal mechanical resonance actually electromechanical resonance effect quite complicated short explanation stepper has intrinsic -degree phase shift position torque speeds rise point coil inductance introduces additional -degree phase shift coil current applied voltage electromechanical system has highly-unstable -degree phase lag thus creates negative feedback loop rapidly drop motor torque until motor loses synchronicity driver's applied voltage stalls resonance occurs coil current limited inductance cannot occur constant-current drive range because enough phase lag applied voltage coil current image description measured torque curves available manufacturers almost never show resonance zones because curves produced loading motors friction-brakes damp kind resonance effect building whereas printer drivetrain load almost entirely inertial accelerating mass much more prone resonance drivers automatically detect damp mid-band resonance typical low-cost printer drivers capability generally prudent avoid entering rpm range mid-band resonance occur easily accomplished sticking left side torque curve constant-current operating region ensures high torque good stability concrete example consider popular kysan stepper power supply image description maintain high torque avoid mid-band resonance want keep rpm less same mm-per-rev pulley mentioned above limit speeds around mm/s higher speeds possible encounter issues speed course assumes psu used match measured torque curve: psu significantly lower top speed before inductance starts limit coil current around half fast higher supply voltage increases top effective speed motor easily simulate effect know back-emf voltage per rpm your motor using back-emf parameter critical higher speeds unfortunately typically provided manufacturer datasheets very easy measure spinning motor known rpm such drill press measuring open-circuit rms ac voltage across one coils simulator output chart shows inductance back-emf keeping coil current reaching target: image description practical drivetrain design motor/driver simulator really best tool toolbox finding point performance start degrade due inability hit current targets simply too complex apply simple equations rules thumb accuracy these electrical effects firmware step generation limits likely two main restrictions motor speed most printers course fast melt plastic tend limit printing speeds significantly below true motor speed limits that's different discussion moment simply say top motor speed tends unimportant print moves typical cartesian printers however few instances likely drive printer performance: deltas carriages need run several times faster effector certain move directions extruders high reduction ratio eg much high retraction speeds lead screws all-thread need high rotation speeds achieve moderate linear speeds

there's answer holds same concepts regarding your questions: lowering temperature help raising yes lowering temperature help found best stay closer lower end material's melting point bit above point help potential extrusion shortens time takes material cool refer link above cause clogging your temperature too low keep eye your drive gear see too much friction lower temperatures increasing keep drive gear your filament speeding slowing down print head help prefer print slower most time allow material cool bit more avoid curling/warping primarily print abs so matters more able give take temperature speed consider your nozzle cooler your speed bridging gaps yield same results proportionately swap these two values concept matter pinch get part again prefer slowing machine down allows current/previous layers cool more before continuing especially helpful overhangs paired lowering your nozzle temperature increasing/decreasing extrusion diameter layer height help assume extrusion diameter equals layer height difference nozzle diameter aka swapping nozzles completely sure think depends part well slicing engine settings makerware pretty good proportionately adjusting extrusion steps layer height so see equal change width extrusion think general larger layer height yield larger extrusion width helpful printing overhangs helpful printing bridges larger strand retain heat longer smaller one helps please comment need more information/clarification 
two most important things are: adequate cooling solidify plastic quickly layer height really obvious need plastic solidify before has chance sag pla particular has shed lot heat before fully solid fan air guide setup using radial blower around nozzle optimal little mm mm axial fan provide optimal performance layer height slicing less obvious extremely effective use thinner layers two things happen: less melted plastic per pass higher surface area volume ratio so fresh material cools faster larger percentage each strand overhang supported previous strand mm thick mm wide half each strand unsupported mm thick mm wide quarter each strand unsupported combine these two effects possible exceed degree overhangs good surface quality lesser factor printing shells/perimeters inside-out rather outside-in helps anchor outermost strand little better overhang built pretty minor though 
typical procedure casting use lost-wax method using pla absolutely fine your part around size flues part part model part mixture sand plaster paris set burn out pla furnace mould debris your metal choice more detailed reference check out following: printing itself advice use small layer height carefully clean part before castin 
came solution involving bitcoin heard speak meta-materials quantum dots being used solve problem special ink equipment expensive latest developments field methods current favourites win race regading solution appreciated encouraged 
having contact lot startups business based printing sometime heard popularization printing ie regular people having house believe good solution gather owners printers modelers final buyer heard similar solutions mailing occur owners final buyers model get free online distribution outsourced printer's owner obvious profit view modeler encouraged well like youtubers creating videos people wants watch view wrong reason technology ready popular demand popular yet
